# Data Talks

This repo contains some of my Machine Learning code.
Kaggle and Driven Data competitions.
Mostly R and Python

This is a work in progress and I just recently started building this new code portfolio.

I am so far focusing on the Driven Data blood donation competition.
2 scripts are available

* Data set exploration
* Feature importance selection and engineering.
